# odin-recipes

Create a recipe web page

The goal of this project is to practice and apply skills acquired through The Odin Project Foundational learning path. Over the course of this project I will use HTML to create a boilerplate web page, add links, images, and emphasise text.

I will use Git to commit code changes to GitHub.
