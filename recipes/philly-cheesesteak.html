        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The combination of thin sliced, juicy ribeye steak and melty-gooey cheese all wrapped up in a soft and warm hoagie roll is seriously hard to beat!</p>
        <p>This recipe uses grass-fed Wagyu Ribeye thinly sliced, a slightly warmed (but not toasted!) traditional hoagie roll, and classic buffalo sauce.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds of thin sliced ribeye steak</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>5 slices of american cheese</li>
            <li>3 hoagie rolls</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Generously season sliced ribeye with salt and pepper. Set aside</li>
            <li>Place a large skillet over medium heat and melt butter.</li>
            <li>Turn heat up to medium-high and add oil.</li>
            <li>Add beef to skillet and sear until just barely cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place 3 slices of american on top of the beef mixture, add 1-2 tablespoons water to the side of the skillet and cover for 1 minute, allowing the steam to melt the cheese.</li>Stir mixture together, top with remaining slices of american, add 2 more tablespoons water to side of skillet and cover for another minute to melt cheese.</li> <li>Uncover and remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Top each hoagie roll and top with 1/3 of the beef mixture. Serve immediately.</li>
